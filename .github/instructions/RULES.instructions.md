# Project Context and Coding Guidelines
Follow these guidelines when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes for this project:

- Use pnpm
- Follow the established coding style and conventions used in the project.
- Use already defined functions, classes, and modules whenever possible to maintain consistency, unless there is a compelling reason to introduce new ones with proper justification which you should clarify with me before proceeding.
